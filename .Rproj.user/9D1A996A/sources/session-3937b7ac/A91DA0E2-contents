when you click the **knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded r code chunks within the document. you can embed an r code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## including plots

you can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=F}
plot(pressure)
```

note that the `echo = F` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the r code that generated the plot.
